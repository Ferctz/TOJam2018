# TOJam2018
This is the Unity (2018.1.0f2) project repo for my TOJAM 13 submission. The name of the game is "When Aliens Arrive" and it can be found at https://ferctz.itch.io/when-aliens-arrive.

I decided to create a third-person, Star Fox inspired flight simulator that showcases destructable buildings. Technically, I wanted to put into practice my understanding of Unity's ScriptableObjects which meant trying to reduce class dependencies across the project.

The objective of the game is to shoot all buildings down before your ship's power runs out. It is heavily encouraged to play using Xbox controllers. Solo mode supports keyboard and controller, while two player mode only recognizes controller input.

Enjoy!
